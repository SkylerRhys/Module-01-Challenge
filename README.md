# Module-01-Challenge
I was tasked with taking provided code and making it more accessible for users. The provided code came from The University of Minnesota's Bootcamp by EdX.

## Challenges
After making the necessary changes, I realized that my page was not deployable because I didn't have the index.html file in the root folder. I found it easier to create a new repository with the file in the correct place. Because of this, my repository only has one commit.

## Changes to Source Code

### Dead Links
The Search Engine Optimization link was not navigating to the correct part of the page due to a dead link. I added an ID to the appropriate part of the page to fix this issue.

### Semantic HTML Elements
The Html was over-reliant on using div with class descriptors. I changed appropriate divs to nav, section, aside, and footer.

### Cleaning up clutter
Three areas were assigned an ID and a class. Because there was only one instance of each, I got rid of the class and kept the ID.

### CSS
I updated the stylesheet to communicate correctly with index.html given the changes that I made.
